# Election Analysis Challenge
Demonstration of Python election analysis for BootCamp DataViz. 

# Overview
Analysis of election results using Python to read in a csv file and provide the following deliverables: 
1. The election results printed to the command line
2. The election results saved to a text file
3. A written analysis of the election audit

The original analysis requested by the Colorado Board of Elections requested an audit of a recent local election for the following data: 
- Total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- Total number of votes each candidate received
- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on the popular vote

Theelection commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit:
- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout

The results are expected to be provided to the terminal and in a text file using the following template:
